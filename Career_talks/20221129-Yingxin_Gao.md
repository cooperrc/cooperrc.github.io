## Modeling work at Otis
### Dr. Yingxin Gao

- Who is Dr. Yingxin Gao?

Dr. Yingxin Gao has a Ph.D. in computational mechanics. She is a former
Cornell University Professor working with Otis working on virtual
design, optimization, ride quality, and root cause analysis. 

- What does she do?

Yingxin uses a combination of finite element analysis softwares
(including Ansys, Abaqus, and Altair Hypermesh), Multibody dynamics
solvers (including Recurdyn), electromagnetic solvers (including Siemens
Magnet), and scripting/data processing tools (including Python, MATLAB,
R and MathCAD). She will also solve differential equations by hand,
but she admits its not for everyone because it requires, "a lot of
coffee and brainpower." Yingxin always uses test data to validate her
model results and revise assumptions and simplifications. She says, "Do
not trust the model outright, check with the mechanics, engineers, and
technicians" before you start making design changes with your models. 

- How does she use engineering education at Otis?

Yingxin uses engineering principles in every model and assumption she
makes. She is able to simulate the worst-case scenarios of elevator
functions from the comfort of an air conditioned desk. She says, "the
model is just a model until you apply the right boundary conditions, do
an engineering sanity check, check your assumptions, define the
limitations of your model, and _validate_ your predictions with
measurements."

- Advice to future engineers

Dr. Yingxin Gao recommends new and future engineers are careful in how
they define and evaluate simulations. Its much easier to start with free
body diagrams and list out your assumptions before building overly
complicated physics models. 

She says the number one question people stumble on interviews is, "In
your FEA model, what type of elements did you use?" or "Why did you use
Von Mises stress for your model results?"

As you learn to simulate engineering structures and assemblies, make
sure you put the fundamental engineering questions and analyses first.
- Do these results make sense?
- Are my model assumptions still valid for these results?
- What are the limits to this prediction?
- How can I _validate_ these predictions with measured data?
