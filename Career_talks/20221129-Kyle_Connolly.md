## Moving and Stopping elevators with Dynamics
### Kyle Connolly - Structures and Design Group

- Who is Kyle Connolly?
 
Kyle Connolly is a UConn engineering graduate and Connecticut native. He first
joined Otis as an intern converting older drum brakes into the current
disc brakes for elevators. He was planning another trip back to UConn to
catch the next basketball game in Gampel. 

- What does he do?

Otis divides the elevators into 14 subsystems, but most of us only ever
see the cab (#3) and thecar doors (#11). Kyle has been involved in
designing, servicing, and optimizing the structures tha  make the
elevator move and more importantly, stop. He recently designed a smaller
elevator motor that operates at 94% efficiency. 
 
- How does he use engineering education at Otis?

Every day, Kyle deals with torque, acceleration, and total distance
travelled to determine elevator bearing life. He has to consider the
number of passengers, direction of car motion, and rope pulleys and
connections. His first step in engineering design is to start with a
free body diagram to find identify forces and torques that are present
in the elevator structures and design. 

- Advice to future engineers

Kyle feels lucky to start his career with Otis as an intern. He highly
recommends the Otis internship program as a great way to make an impact
and meet great people. 

The interview question that seems to trip new engineers up is, "Why do
you want to work at Otis?" Kyle recommends spending 10-20 minutes
researching any company you go to interview, 
- what's their mission statement? 
- how does it align with your career goals? 
- what do you want to add to the company? 
- what's exciting to you?
