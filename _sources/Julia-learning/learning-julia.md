# Sharing my Julia learning journey

I have been interested in learning Julia for the past few years. It is 
- fast
- dynamic
- reproducible
- composable
- general purpose

and the Open Source community is growing and doing all the things I
love: processing data, building scientific models, and sharing great
resources. 

## Background in Scientific Computing

I started scientific computing in MATLAB as a grad student in 2008. I
was building 1D beam mechanics models for our research group. Then, I
needed to run scientific calculations in between finite element analyses
(in Abaqus) and use the results. Python was a natural migration from
MATLAB because it is such a great all-purpose _glue_ language. Almost
every engineering software I use has some SDK with Python as the
interface. 

## Current tools = Python

Now, I have been teaching scientific computing in engineering courses
for over 5 years and taught over 90 credits worth of courses for
undergrads and grads. I push Python as a general purpose tool that does
everything

- symbolic math ([SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/))
- linear algebra ([NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/))
- Integrating, ODEs, PDEs, and more ([SciPy](https://www.scipy.org))
- Plotting and visualization ([Matplotlib](https://www.matplotlib.org))
- Data processing and exploration ([Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org))

I **love** these libraries, the communities, the possibilities. 

## Ready for Julia!

Then, I read  [Why We Use Julia, 10 Years
Later](https://julialang.org/blog/2022/02/10years/). It is a wonderful
a collection of people descibing the same interests and backgrounds that
I love all joining together to share their journeys. Now, I _have to
find_ out what the draw to Julia is. Some initial guesses, based upon my
work with Python:
- the Julia community: the posts and interactions I've seen are
  positive, welcoming, and helpful. Its so new and exciting to everyone
  involved
- the syntax: looking at code examples (_just a few so far_), it looks
  like the language is meant to reflect math ideas directly and
  succintly. I'm looking forward to diving into this language
- the documentation: One quick thing I learned was that docs are written
  in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Markdown has been my
  preferred website/doc/notetaking format. I still get confused with
  Sphinx and $\LaTeX$ feels like its built just for writing theses. 
  
## Getting started

I decided I will take 20-30 min per day to experiment with Julia and all
its possibilities. I'm looking forwar  to taking some of my Python work
and porting it over to Julia and even trying some new work with existing
examples and tutorials from the Julia community. I hope you enjoy these
posts as I find my way through this new language.
